   → Back to Google-OAuth-only schema

✅ backend/routes/auth.js  
   → Only /api/auth/google endpoint
   → Removed email/password endpoints

Files to Manually Delete (6 files):
====================================
These new files won't work with reverted code. Delete them:

1. frontend/src/features/authSlice.js
2. frontend/src/pages/Register.jsx
3. frontend/src/styles/Auth.css
4. frontend/.env.local
5. backend/middleware/adminMiddleware.js
6. backend/middleware/checkRole.js

Optional Deletions (13 files - documentation):
==============================================
For a cleaner project, optionally delete documentation about new auth:

1. AUTHENTICATION_INDEX.md
2. AUTH_QUICK_START.md
3. AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md
4. AUTH_CHECKLIST.md
5. AUTHENTICATION_COMPLETE.md
6. IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.txt
7. SETUP_COMMANDS.sh
8. AUTH_CHECKLIST.md
9. REVERTED_TO_ORIGINAL.md
10. CLEANUP_INSTRUCTIONS.txt
11. REVERT_COMPLETE.txt (this file)

Note: Keep REVERTED_TO_ORIGINAL.md and CLEANUP_INSTRUCTIONS.txt
as reference for what was done.

Current System State:
====================
✅ Google OAuth Authentication only
✅ Role selection (student/teacher)
✅ Role-based redirects
✅ Protected routes working
✅ Redux state management
✅ localStorage token persistence
✅ No email/password auth
✅ No OTP system

Next Steps:
===========
1. Delete the 6 new files listed above
2. cd backend && npm install
3. cd frontend && npm install
4. cd backend && npm run dev
5. cd frontend && npm run dev
6. Open http://localhost:5173
7. Test Google login

Everything should work as before!
