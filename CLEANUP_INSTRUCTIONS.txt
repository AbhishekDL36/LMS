PROJECT CLEANUP - REMOVE NEW AUTHENTICATION FILES
===================================================

STEP 1: Delete These 6 Files (New files that were created)
==========================================================

1. frontend/src/features/authSlice.js
2. frontend/src/pages/Register.jsx
3. frontend/src/styles/Auth.css
4. frontend/.env.local
5. backend/middleware/adminMiddleware.js
6. backend/middleware/checkRole.js

STEP 2: Optional - Delete Documentation Files
===============================================

These files were created to document the new auth system.
You can delete them for a cleaner project:

7. AUTHENTICATION_INDEX.md
8. AUTH_QUICK_START.md
9. AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md
10. AUTH_CHECKLIST.md
11. AUTHENTICATION_COMPLETE.md
12. IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.txt
13. SETUP_COMMANDS.sh

STEP 3: What Was Already Reverted
==================================

These files were modified and automatically restored to original:
- backend/models/User.js
- backend/routes/auth.js
- backend/package.json
- frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx
- frontend/src/app/store.js
- frontend/src/router/router.jsx
- frontend/src/App.jsx
- frontend/src/main.jsx
- frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx
- frontend/package.json

STEP 4: Reinstall Dependencies
==============================

After deleting the files, reinstall dependencies:

cd backend
npm install

cd ../frontend
npm install

STEP 5: Test the Application
=============================

npm run dev (in both folders)

Open http://localhost:5173

Test Google OAuth login - should work as before!
